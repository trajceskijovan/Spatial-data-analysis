# Background:

The map was created based on five files:
1.	USA base map shp - source:  the census.gov 
2.	Obesity Rate csv  -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
3.	Physical Inactivity Rate csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
4.	Diabetes Rate csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
5.	Hypertension csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)

I filtered out few geographical areas such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico for better visibility, presentation, and simplicity in the preprocessing stage. I also created a custom clean theme to be applied to the map.

The map contains four visualizations, one for each topic: obesity, inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension. The goal is to analyze obesity in the USA and related drivers and implications by state.

Two maps were created with different designs and formats.
