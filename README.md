# Background:

The map was created based on five files:
1.	USA base map shp - source:  the census.gov 
2.	Obesity Rate csv  -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
3.	Physical Inactivity Rate csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
4.	Diabetes Rate csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)
5.	Hypertension csv -  source: Center for Disease Control (CDC)

I filtered out few geographical areas such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico for better visibility, presentation, and simplicity in the preprocessing stage. I also created a custom clean theme to be applied to the map.

The map contains four visualizations, one for each topic: obesity, inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension. The goal is to analyze obesity in the USA and related drivers and implications by state.

Two maps were created with different designs and formats.

# Takeaway:

1. The map indicates a high obesity problem in the state of Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama.
2. We can also see high physical inactivity for the same states compared to the rest of the USA. 
3. Diabetes is highest in West Virginia and Mississippi.
4. Lastly, hypertension is highest in Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama.
5. This map indicates that the USA needs to develop a targeted strategy for obesity within the SouthEast region.
